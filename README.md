# Wizard Familiar

This is a bot designed to monitor some official social
media accounts of Wizards of the Coast employees - mostly
those that work on their Magic: the Gathering product.
Public postings will be mirrored from a number of sources
to a single Discord channel. Some of these sources are:

* Twitter

* Reddit

* Mark Rosewater's blog on Tumblr

This is very much a personal project. No guarantee of
safety or functionality is expressed or implied. Pull
at your own risk.
